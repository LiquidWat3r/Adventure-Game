        <h1> You when hanging out with your friends in Downtown, CityArea, and had a lot of fun! You guys went to the arcade and ate a lot of food! After meeting up with your friends you are heading to your car to leave and go home, but there is traffic so you are stuck in the middle of Downtown. Suddenly, your stomach begins to rumble, the bubbling sensation and the growling sound produced from your stomach is fierce. Checkmate. You need to poop. Decide on what you want to do.
