        <h1> Since you bought a drink you are now considered a customer so you head into the bathroom. As you set foot inside the bathroom you are paralyzed by the condition of the bathroom. Everything inside the bathroom looks like it is radiating diseases, the toilet was broken and leaking, but the urnial... the urnial is probably the cleanest thing you have seen in your whole life. Its white tile like material is perfectly polished and waxed. So clean that you are able to see yourself as if it was mirror. You can no longer hold in your poop, what do you do?  </h1>
